**A minimal approach to personal finance**

Checking Account: Hold all incoming or outgoing money - keep your monthly rent plus $500 here as a buffer. You'll want a debit card attached to this account for paying bills. I recommend going with one of your credit card providers for simplicity.

Credit Cards: Having a few solid no-fee credit cards can allow you to collect rewards and build credit. All cards should be setup to auto-pay the full balence each month from your checking account.

401k and TRAD/ROTH IRA: Maxing out both of these tax-advantaged accounts is the first order of bussiness after expenses are taken care of. This should be acheivable for most young people - It costs ~24k/year with a decent employer match and provides a serious tax discount. When choosing between a roth or traditional IRA, if you make <100k, ROTH IRA is likely the best option, and if you make >100k, traditional IRA will most likely be better. All money in this account should be in index funds or target date funds that balance your portfolio to reduce risk when nearing your retirment date.

Other investments: Any money left over should go here - There's many directions you could go with this, but large low cost index funds, rental properties, or investing in your own skills or personal business could be a great option. This account can also be where your emergency fund can be located.
