**A minimal approach to personal finance**

Checking Account: Hold all incoming or outgoing money - keep your monthly rent plus $500 here as a buffer. You'll want a debit card attached to this account for paying bills. Doesn't really matter where this is from, might as well go with one of your credit card providers

Credit Cards: Having a few solid no-fee credit cards can allow you to collect rewards and build credit. Set all cards to auto-pay through your checking account. I recommend this credit card website:

401k and TRAD/ROTH IRA: Take advantage of your employer match and max out both of these accounts. Most young people should be able to do this - Should cost ~24k/year with a decent employer match. For and IRA, if you make <50k, ROTH IRA is the best option, and if you make >100k, traditional IRA will be better. From 50k-100k, It really depends on your situation and retirment plan - I recommend this reddit article.

TARGET DATE FUND: A great investment option from vangaurd that will adjust your portfolio balence over time to minimize risk as you get closer to retirement.

Other investment accounts: This is where you can choose to diversify the way you use your extra money - There's many directions you could go with this, but large low cost index funds, rental properties, investing in your own skills or a personal business could be a great option. This is also where your emergency fund should be located, in a safe assest like a money market fund.
